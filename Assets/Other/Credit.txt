This collection of libre fonts is created by designers who have drawn these fonts and then allowed everyone to use, share, change and improve the fonts, free of charge. If you like the fonts that designers create within this project, then you can take part even if you are not a designer — with your money, in the spirit of charity «ON your heart». All the money is will transferred to the treatment of children with cancer.
