    description: A magical healer to lift this curse
  succeed: This is one tricky curse. You manage to lift it from him but the dark energy
    floats off before you can destroy it. Whatever, at least you did what you came
    here to do.
  fail: "This curse is really in there. It\u2019d take someone a little more knowledgeable
    than you to get this thing out."
